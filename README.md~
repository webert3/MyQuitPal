MyQuitPal
Ongoing research project under Dr. Moushumi Sharmin at Western Washington University.

#Goal
We want to use real-time stress/activity intensity data to help users live healthier lives.

# Current Development
We are currently focused on promoting smoking cessation.

I am developing the prototype for an android app that displays useful information and data visualizations for smokers who are trying to quit. All data used in this prototype are from a research study run by one of our collaborators. This set contains quantitative stress/activity intensity data, as well as some qualitative data collected from participants in the experiment. This will be a preliminary build to get user feedback on the interface design.

The next step will utilizing wearable technology to provide close to real-time data that can be used in conjunction with our app.
